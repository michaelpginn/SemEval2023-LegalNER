# SemEval2023-LegalNER

https://sites.google.com/view/legaleval/home

This repo is associated with the subtask "Sub-task B: Legal Named Entities Extraction (L-NER)" of SemEval 2023, Task 6.

## Task
The goal of this project is to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) on Indian legal texts. General-purpose NER systems tend to perform poorly on legal texts, so a specialized system is desirable.

## Experiments
### 1. Minimal Baseline Model
The first model will use a simple Transformer-based model that uses word-level embeddings and a RoBERTa Transformer, much like the baseline presented in https://github.com/Legal-NLP-EkStep/legal_NER. 

### 2. LegalBERT Model
This model will replace the general-purpose RoBERTa with the specialized LegalBERT transformer.

### To be continued...
