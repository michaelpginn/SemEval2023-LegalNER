Kaurav, Advocate General with Shri Pushpendra Yadav,\nDeputy Advocate General and Shri Amit Seth, Government Advocate for the\nrespondents/State.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhether Approved for Reporting : Yes\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLaw Laid Down:\n\n   \uf0b7 The expression \"ascertained amount\" appearing in Section 2(1)(d) of the M.P.\n       Madhyastham Adhikaran Adhiniyam, 1983 (for short \"the State Act\") includes the\n       amount of consequential relief.\n\n   \uf0b7 Mere declaration of termination of contract is not the substantial relief and in the\n       guise of mere declaration an aggrieved person cannot be permitted to omit the\n       consequential relief which the party may be entitled to claim in a reference under the\n       M.P. Madhyastham Adhikaran Adhiniyam, 1983.\n\n   \uf0b7 It is held that reading of Sub-section (2) of Section 7-A of the M.P. Madhyastham\n       Adhikaran Adhiniyam, 1983 makes it abundantly clear that if a consequential relief\n       was available to an aggrieved person before the date of making reference under Sub-\n       section (1) of Section 7-A of the State Act yet he failed to include the claim of\n                                                                                    Ac-40-2016\n                                               2\n\n\n\n       consequential relief, such person will not be entitled to claim such relief in any\n       subsequent proceedings.\n\n   \uf0b7 As regards the second question framed, challenge to revenue recovery certificate\n       under the guise of challenge to only termination of agreement is not tenable because\n       the consequential relief is to that of challenge to recovery certificate.\n\n   \uf0b7 The view expressed in Single Bench decisions of this Court reported as 2003 (1)\n       M.P.H.T 205 (M.P. Housing Board vs. Satish Kumar Raizada) and order dated\n       16.02.2010 passed in M.A. No. 1030/1999 (M.P. Housing Board vs. Satish Kumar\n       Raizada) is not the correct enunciation of law. There cannot be any simpliciter\n       declaration of fixation of rates of work. An aggrieved person has to claim a\n       particular rate of work which the Court may or may not grant but the quantification\n       of rate of work was required to be made. The astuteness in drafting of the reference\n       so as to not to claim any money though ascertainable will not oust the reference\n       before the statutory Arbitral Tribunal under the State Law.\n\n   \uf0b7 The finding recorded by a Full Bench of this Court in a judgment reported as 2017\n       (2) Mplj 681 (Viva Highways Ltd. vs. Madhya Pradesh Road Development\n       Corporation Ltd.) to the extent that if the State Act is not applicable and there is\n       arbitration clause, the aggrieved person has the liberty to invoke the Central Act is\n       not tenable. - Orders of the Supreme Court passed in Civil Appeal No.974/2012\n       (Madhya Pradesh Rural Road Development Authority and Another vs. M/s\n       L.G. Chaudhary Engineers and Contractors) and Civil Appeal No.2615/2018\n       (State of Madhya Pradesh and others vs. Gammon India Ltd.) - Relied.\n\nSignificant Paragraph Nos.: 1, 3 to 16, 21, 28 to 55\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOrder Reserved on : 05.04.2018\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n                                     Order\n"

Rule 53 of M.P. Minor Mineral Rules, 1996,\n    as substituted vide Notification dated 18.5.2017, traces its source to Section 23C of\n    the Act. Such Rule 53 does not substitute the trial for an offence as contemplated\n    under Section 21 of the Act but is in addition to the offence contemplated under\n    Section 21 of the Act to meet the issue of illegal extraction and transportation of\n    minerals, which has attained gigantic proportion.\n\n\uf0b7   Confiscation under Rule 53 of the Rules is not a punishment,which could be imposed\n    in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 21 of the Act. The confiscation\n                                                               Wp-18818/2017 & Wp-19320-2017\n                                               2\n\n     under Rule 53 is independent proceeding and does not affect the legality and validity\n     of the confiscation contemplated under Section 21 of the Act, which also provides for\n     imprisonment.\n\n\uf0b7    The State as an owner of the minerals is protecting its property in the best possible\n     manner by imposing penalties in a graded manner so that repeat violators are\n     imposed higher penalty, which ultimately leads to confiscation of the vessels and\n     tools. The object of such confiscation proceedings is to stop menace of illegal\n     transportation of minerals, therefore, there is no illegality in Notification substituting\n     Rule 53 of the 1996 Rules issued by the State Government in exercise of powers\n     under Sub-section (1) of Section 15 of the 1957 Act.\n\nSignificant Paragraph Nos.: 7, 11 to 15, 20 to 22, 24 to 26\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nReserved On : 02.02.2018\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                    Order\n"

Heard Shri Abhishek, learned counsel for appellants and Shri Nishant Mehrotra appearing on behalf of the Insurance Company. None appears for the owner of the vehicle. We had partly allowed the appeal but had kept reasons to be penned later on as the Courts were closing for the Holi Vacations. We now Penn our reasons for allowing the appeal, filed at the behest of claimants who have been put to great injustice by the orders of the ld officers manning the Tribunals, from 2010, while losing sight of the beneficial provisions of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as 'Act' ). \n\n2. After the judgment was dictated we directed the office to upload the same on 14.4.2021. But immediately after directing the judgment to upload, we thought of again going through the judgment for our satisfaction when we read the judgment, unfortunately, while going through the manuscript, we found that there were certain repetitions, the paraphrasing was not proper and therefore, we directed the office not to issue the certified copy and delete the same on 14.4.2021 itself and we have corrected the manuscript again without changing the final result. This was necessary so as to maintain a better chronology and make it a more comprehensive and readable judgment. We can say that these changes were necessary to make it a more readable judgment interpreting the provisions of Order 9 Rule 13 of Code of Civil Procedure 1908 herein after referred as C.P.C. and for directing the Tribunals, on the course which they should adopt in such cases. \n\n The Changes Can Be Said To Be More Of Style In Writing So This Mention As Some Might Have Downloaded And Read The Judgment"
